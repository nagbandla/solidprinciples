SOLID principles - Robert C Martin - Uncle Bob

S === Single Responsibility
		A class should be designed for one purpose. And it should have only single
		reason to change.
		Class should not fill with excessive functionality - just one functionality

O === Open Close principle
	  A class should be open for extension and closed for modification. 
	  IOW, In order to implement new features, should not be rewritting the class, instead extend the class
L === Liskov Substitution
	  Objects of sub classes should be substitutable with objects of super class.

I === Interface segregation
	  Interfaces should not force its concrete classes to implement (unnecessary) methods.
	  Divide fat interfaces into smaller interfaces.
	  
D === Dependency Inversion 
      Abstractions should not depend on details- concrete classes. Instead details(concrete classes) should
      depend on abstractions
